I am currently a student at Oregon Health & Science University in the MS Biostatistics program with an anticipated graduation date of June 2020. In addition to being a student, I am a Senior Research Assistant for OHSU School of Nursing performing data analysis, reporting, and visualization to evaluate academic degree programs. 

Along with my experience assessing educational outcomes, I have experience researching the effect of exercise and diet on cognitive functioning using fMRI data and analyzing disparities in rural and urban youth suicide rates in Oregon. My current research interests include applying my statistical knowledge to the fields of genetics, public health, and neuroscience. Along with my professional interests, I also enjoy hiking, photography, reading, and spending time with my husky, Zeus.
